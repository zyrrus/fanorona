This is a board game that has a surprisingly complicated set of rules to implement. I built this a long time ago, and at the time it was my biggest project.  
I'll admit that it's terribly written, and I would definitely change a lot if I were to rebuild it today. However, we all had to start somewhere, and I like seeing how much I've progressed.

# What I used

JS, p5.js, SCSS

# What I learned

-   Imperative UI
-   JavaScript (This was my first JS project)
-   Safari doesn't like p5.js
